# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to the Python Projects repository! This repository serves as a collection of various Python projects created for learning purposes. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore Python or an experienced programmer honing your skills, you'll find a variety of projects here to experiment with and learn from.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a space for experimenting with Python programming concepts. None of the projects within this repository are intended for real-world applications. Instead, they are meant to serve as learning exercises, allowing you to practice coding, explore different libraries and frameworks, and deepen your understanding of Python.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **bidding_game**: This Python script implements a simple bidding game where participants can anonymously submit their bids, and the program determines the highest bidder.

2. **Coffee Machine**: This is a simple Python script that simulates the functionality of a coffee machine. Users can choose from a selection of coffee types (espresso, latte, cappuccino), check the available resources, and receive a report on the machine's current status. The script also allows users to insert coins to pay for their coffee.

3. **nato_phonetic_encoder**: This Python script utilizes the NATO phonetic alphabet to encode words into their corresponding phonetic codes.

4. **quiz**: This Python script is a simple quiz game that utilizes a question bank containing various questions and their respective answers. Players are presented with questions one by one and must provide answers. After completing the quiz, the player's final score is displayed.

5. **snake_game**: This Python script is an implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle module. In this game, players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body.
