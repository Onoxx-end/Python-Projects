# Snake Game README

This Python script is an implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle module. In this game, players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body.

## Getting Started

To play the Snake game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located using the command line or terminal.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

## How to Play

1. Upon running the script, the Snake game will start automatically.

2. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys:

   - Up: Move the snake upward.
   - Down: Move the snake downward.
   - Left: Move the snake to the left.
   - Right: Move the snake to the right.

3. Eat the food (green square) to grow longer.

4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

5. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

6. Your final score will be displayed on the screen.

7. Enjoy playing and challenge yourself to achieve a high score!
